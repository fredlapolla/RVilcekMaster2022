#1. Try using is.na and na.omit to remove from CADMIUM and LEAD respectively.




#2. Try using recode_factor to change the values of DX_DBTS to "diabetes with dx", "diabetes no dx" and "no diabetes" (it's ok to abbreviate).





#3. Try using Mutate to make a new variable of Total cholesterol divided by HDL. This is not a real clinical metric (as far as I know) but is intended to practice Mutate.



#4. Use GREP to find only the members of K with a B. Try also using gsub to change B to BGroup.
