# Session 5 Group Work for Exploratory Data Visualization

#1. Try to make a histogram of MERCURYU and LDL Estimate. Are these  normally distributed or skewed, and if so, which way?



#2. Make a box plot of A1C by diabetes diagnosis. Are they likely the same for both groups?


#3. Make a qq plot of LDL. Also make one for MercuryU. Would you expect either of these to be normal or skewed? How can you tell?



#4. If we wanted to make a scatter plot of lead by cotinine, how would we do it? Based on what you now know about assessing skew, what test might we run for this?
