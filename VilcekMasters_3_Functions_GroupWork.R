# R Session 3 Functions Group Work

## Group Work Apply 1

#A Z Score is a standardized measure of how far a value is from the mean, in standardized units. The equation is 

#Z = (x - mu)/sd 

#X is the value in any given cell; Mu is the mean of the column or variable; Sd is the standard deviation fo that colum.
#This can be phrased as the observation (i.e. the value in a cell) - the mean of the column or variable, divided by the standard deviation. 

#Try using apply to calculate first the standard deviation, then the mean of Lead, total blood mercury, HDL and total cholesterol. 





#Then using these values try to find the Z score of each cell in these columns.




# Group Work 2

#Create a dichotomous variable of diabetes diagnosis, so either has a diabetes or not (collapsing from three groups to two).



## Group Work 3

#Make a filtered subset of straing to only contain the aged group nyc using tidyverse's Filter command.





## Group Work4 : Use of filter and operators

#Use filter to retrieve a subset of only the males with diabetes in this data using filter and operators like &, |, =, or !=.
